## Generating distribution archives

Make sure you have the latest versions of `setuptools` and `wheel` installed:

```Bash
$ sudo pip install --upgrade pip
$ python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade setuptools wheel
```

Now run this command from the same directory where `setup.py` is located:

```Bash
$ python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```

This command should output a lot of text and once completed should generate two files in the dist directory:

```Bash
dist/
	Hanmei_Tang-example-package-name-to-be-distributed-2019.2.24.tar.gz
	Hanmei_Tang_example_package_name_to_be_distributed-2019.2.24-py3-none-any.whl
```

## Uploading the distribution archives

Now that you are registered, you can use twine to upload the distribution packages. Youâ€™ll need to install Twine:
```
$ python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade twine
$ cd ~/repos/packaging_tutorial
$ python3 -m twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*
```
